# Chat Handoff Snapshot

Generated for chat transfer. If this snapshot conflicts with `PROJECT.md`, `docs/CONTEXT.md` or `docs/PROGRESS.md`, those canonical files win.

Repository: `MysterioCrypto/domain_generator`.

Active development line: `dev/0.2`. Do **not** reconstruct current state from `main`.

First read, in order:

docs/design/effective-surface-moisture-v0.2.md
docs/design/vegetation-biome-readiness-v0.2.md
```

Current checkpoint: **deferred hydro-surface finishing — choose/design one bounded slice**.

Accepted and frozen:
- Terrain 0.2;
- Hydrology 0.2 routing/network;
- C1 Annual Climate Forcing;
- C2 Effective Surface Moisture;
- C3 Climate-Aware Vegetation.

C3:
- design PR #84 merged;
- implementation PR #85 merged;
- merge commit: `37e213ebf5f82ebfae149d21088c07e08d836549`;
- V01–V11 GREEN;
- C3-A workflow GREEN and formally ACCEPTED:
  `https://github.com/MysterioCrypto/domain_generator/actions/runs/36842261493`.

C3 semantics:
```text
accepted C2 moisture
× normalized annual thermal suitability
+ vegetation_bias
-> vegetation_density

canonical water = 0
```

`vegetation_density` is an abstract normalized ecological potential index, not percent canopy cover or literal NPP.

Mountain influence:
- C1 elevation/lapse-rate temperature;
- C1 windward/lee precipitation;
- C2 slope retention;
- terrain-shaped hydrology feeding C2;
- no second direct C3 slope penalty.

Next design candidates:
- perennial / seasonal / dry low-order channels;
- diffuse headwater roots / low-order visibility;
- lake vs wetland/playa/dry basin;
- delta/estuary/fan where receiving environment is known.

Do not reopen the accepted hydrology routing/network body without concrete evidence.

Process rule:
after every meaningful implementation/decision slice, update external context so a chat failure loses at most the current unfinished step.
