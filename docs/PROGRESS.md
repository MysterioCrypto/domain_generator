# Project Progress Tree

Purpose: compact handoff state. For reasoning read `docs/CONTEXT.md`; for normative semantics read accepted `docs/design/*`.

## IN PROGRESS

```text
Hydro-surface finishing — H11-A DESIGN OPERATOR REVIEW
├─ readiness audit — DONE
├─ design PR #86 — draft/open
└─ runtime implementation — NOT STARTED
```

Accepted hydrology routing/network remains frozen.

## NEXT

```text
1. operator review H11-A design PR #86
2. explicit design ACCEPT / REJECT
3. ACCEPT → merge design
4. implementation: export accepted potential_drainage network only
5. X01–X08 guardrails + contract/operator evidence
6. explicit implementation ACCEPT / REJECT
7. close unsupported hydro classifications as still deferred
8. then continue Placement
```

Do not bundle all deferred hydrology finishing into one change.

## Deferred candidates

```text
perennial / seasonal / dry low-order channel classification
diffuse headwater roots / low-order visibility
standing lake vs wetland / playa / dry basin
delta / estuary / fan morphology
biome labels
Placement continuation
```

## Acceptance boundary

```text
accepted design
+ green automation
+ operator-visible output
+ explicit operator ACCEPT
= accepted spatial semantic layer
```
