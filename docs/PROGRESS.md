# Project Progress Tree

Purpose: compact handoff state. For reasoning read `docs/CONTEXT.md`; for normative semantics read accepted `docs/design/*`.

## IN PROGRESS

```text
Hydro-surface finishing — DESIGN NEXT
└─ environmental context is now available from C1/C2/C3
```

Accepted hydrology routing/network remains frozen.

## NEXT

```text
1. inspect deferred hydro-surface candidates against current contracts
2. choose one bounded finishing slice
3. design ACCEPT / REJECT
4. implementation + automated guardrails
5. representative operator-visible checkpoint
6. explicit implementation ACCEPT / REJECT
7. repeat only for remaining useful deferred slices
8. then continue Placement
```

Do not bundle all deferred hydrology finishing into one change.

## Deferred candidates

```text
perennial / seasonal / dry low-order channel classification
diffuse headwater roots / low-order visibility
standing lake vs wetland / playa / dry basin
delta / estuary / fan morphology
biome labels
Placement continuation
```

## Acceptance boundary

```text
accepted design
+ green automation
+ operator-visible output
+ explicit operator ACCEPT
= accepted spatial semantic layer
```
